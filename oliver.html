				Oliver "Ollie" Riedel (born 11 April 1971) is a German musician, notable for being the bassist for the German Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte band Rammstein.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oliver Riedel was born on 11 April 1971, in Schwerin. Growing up, Oliver had relatively good relationships with both of his parents. He attributes this to the small gap in between their ages. As a child, Oliver wasn't a good student, but he made his way through school with the assistance of his mother. Oliver was quite shy, especially during his teenage years, and while his friends partied at discos, he would often be found just "hanging around".
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1990, at the age of nineteen, Oliver began playing in a folk-fiddle/punk-rock band called The Inchtabokatables. In 1994, Riedel, Till Lindemann, Richard Z. Kruspe, and Christoph "Doom" Schneider entered and won the Berlin Senate Metro beat contest that allowed them to record a four-track demo professionally. Paul H. Landers and Christian "Flake" Lorenz would later join the band they named Rammstein.
			</p>
			<p>
				The six released their first album, Herzeleid (Heartache) in September 1995. Their second album, Sehnsucht (Longing) was released in 1997, which would later become platinum. In April 2001, the album Mutter (Mother) was released and a European tour followed, ending on 13 July 2002. It has been reported that at this time the members of Rammstein were seriously discussing whether to continue or not in their present form. It was decided that they should all take some time off and then reconsider whether to continue.
			</p>
			<p>
				He has two children, one a girl named Emma, and is separated from her mother.
			</p>
			<p>
				He likes photography and sports, especially skateboarding and surfing. In the making of the video for "Keine Lust," he mentions wanting to go snowboarding while wearing a fat suit. It has been said he is the most computer-literate member of the band.
			</p>
			<p>
				He tends to keep his hair crew cut or completely shaven, accompanied by a goatee. He is also the tallest member of the band, standing at 2 metres (6 ft 7 in).
